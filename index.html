          <h1> Introduction </h1>
           <p> I'm a student at Thinkful, learning to be a Software Developer living in Mesa, Arizona. </p>
           <p> Skilled in JavaScript, HTML, CSS and still learning.</p>
           <p> I'm growing my tech skills to step into the world of coding. </p>

          <h2> About Me </h2>
           <p> After graduating college, my passion was for teaching math and inspiring students. It was not long into my teaching career before I knew that this was not the right fit. However, I still wanted to support schools and student learning. </p>
           <p> This thought process led me to supporting a technology that serviced school districts to ultimately make the teaching life just a little bit easier. I've worked alongside developers to enhance a product and solve day to day problems.<p>
           <p> Being involved in this new world that I had never known of brought up some of that passion I had originally when I was in the classroom. Working with code ignites my brain to work harder to solve problems and create something new. Collaborating with others to get feedback and discuss design options lets me know that I can create my best work.</p>
