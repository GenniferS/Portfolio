          <h2> About Me </h2>
           <p> After graduating college, I became a Middle School Math teacher in Mesa, Arizona. I loved working with students but, it wasn't long into my career before I felt the additional pressures that all teachers will eventually face. </p>
           <p> However, I knew I still had that passion for Education and the classroom. This thought process led me to supporting a technology that serviced school districts to ultimately make the teaching life just a little bit easier. <p>
           <p> Being a part of the tech world for 7-years has been eye-opening. I've worked alongside developers to enhance a product and solve day to day problems. This new world that I had never known of brought up some of that passion I had orginally had when I was in the classroom. </p>
           <p> Working with code ignites my brain to work harder to solve problems and create something new. Working with others to get feedback and discuss design options lets me know that I can create my best work.</p>
