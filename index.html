          <h2> About Me </h2>
           <p> After graduating college, I became a Middle School Math teacher in Mesa, Arizona. I loved teaching students and working with them through one of the most challenging subjects. It was always a great day when one student said "I get this!" </p>
           <p> It wasn't long into my teaching career before I felt the additional pressures that all teachers will face, and soon knew that I did not have the same passion as I once did. However, I knew I still had a passion for Education and the classroom. <p>
           <p> This thought process led me to my current career of working in Customer Support servicing school districts to ultimately make the teaching life just a little bit easier through technology. </p>
           <p> However, after a 7 year long career, it's time for growth in my abilities and here I am as a Software Developer!! </p>
